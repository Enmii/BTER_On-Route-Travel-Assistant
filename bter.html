	<h1> On Route Travel Assistant using A* Search Algorithm</h1>
	<h2> Disclaimer</h2>
	<p> This project was developed by Big Tech Energy Reformed. 
	The project's goal is to develop a routing application that allows its users to find public transport routes within the 4th District of Metro Manila.
	This application uses Google's geolocation services to find the user's current location within the map. 
	Please keep in mind that the application only takes the device's location as private data and the application does not keep user data in its system.
